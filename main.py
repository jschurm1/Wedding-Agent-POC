sample_prompt = """You are the world's greatest image evaluator, specializing in analyzing brochures from wedding venues. 
   Your task is to extract and structure pricing details from the attached image. Specifically, return only the following details in JSON format:

   - Each package should be a nested JSON object inside "pricing".
   - Each package must include:
     - Package name
     - Price per person
     - Additional package details

   - If there are additional costs beyond per-person pricing, extract and return them under "additional_cost".  
   - Additional costs can include (but are not limited to) venue fees, mandatory gratuity, service charges, ceremony fees, or any other extra expenses.  

   **Formatting Requirements:**  
   Strictly follow this structure:

   {
     "pricing": {
       "package_one": {
         "package_name": "<<insert package one name>>",
         "price_per_person": <<insert pricing of package one>>,
         "additional_details": "<<insert package one additional details>>"
       },
       "package_two": {
         "package_name": "<<insert package two name>>",
         "price_per_person": <<insert pricing of package two>>,
         "additional_details": "<<insert package two additional details>>"
       }
     },
     "additional_cost": {
       "additional_cost_one": {
         "additional_cost_one_description": "<<description of additional cost>>",
         "additional_cost_one_cost": <<additional cost dollar amount>>
       },
       "additional_cost_two": {
         "additional_cost_two_description": "<<description of additional cost>>",
         "additional_cost_two_cost": <<additional cost dollar amount>>
       }
     }
   }

   **Important Rules:**  
   - If this page does not contain pricing or additional cost information, skip it entirely and return nothing.  
   - If pricing or additional costs are present, return only the details specified aboveâ€”nothing more.  
   - Ensure JSON keys match the specified structure exactly.  
   - Exclude any unnecessary information beyond pricing and additional costs.
